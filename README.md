# hexagon

A helper for tasks subtask distribution

### Implemented in shell (.sh) 
  - usable on MacOS
  - Not tested on other os
  - Navigate to /shell and read README  
#### Will be implemented in js again

## future plan

-   add more supported languages
-   clean up the code
-   prettify the table
-   may need to migrate to another language (after testing: js might be the fittest)
-   sort alphanumerically
-   test on other os
