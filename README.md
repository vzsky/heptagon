# heptagon

A helper for tasks subtask distribution

### Implemented in shell (.sh) 
  - usable on MacOS
  - Not tested on other os
  - Navigate to /shell and read README  
  
### Implemented in nodejs (.js) 
  - usable on MacOS
  - Not tested on other os
  - Navigate to /js 
  - install via npm

## future plan

-   add more supported languages
-   clean up the code
-   prettify the table
-   may need to migrate to another language (after testing: js might be the fittest)
-   sort alphanumerically
-   test on other os

## note

It's possible to have better grading experience ( faster grading time ) by allowing tasks to be graded at the same time, which can be efficiently done in js using promises, but it will lead to high cpu usage and result in all TLE on every solution and tasks
